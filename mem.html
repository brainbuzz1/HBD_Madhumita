        <div class="write">We share a lots of bond with each other like branchmates, friends, teacher-student and the one which I consider the most, brother-sister. These all bond are made only in a few months and hope gets stronger with time. I will not lie but in online I made a chubby personaliy of you in my mind, I don't know why but I did😅😅. I was totally shocked when I have seen You physically.</div>

        <div class="write">Now it's time for complains: the very first complain is that you talk veryy less. Your roommates used to do chappar-chappar all the time, atleast learn a bit from them. Secondly I don't need to mention your sleep cycle,you are speading this like a flu. Except this you are perfect. Also it is no need to change these too because this are the things which diffrentiate you from others.</div>
